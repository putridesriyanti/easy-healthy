# Easy Healthy - App Installation Instructions

I have created the full source code for your "Easy Healthy" mobile application.
Since Node.js is not installed on your system, I could not automatically run the app.

Please follow these steps to run the application:

## 1. Install Prerequisites
- Download and install **Node.js**: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) (Download the LTS version).
- Download and install **Git**: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
- Restart your computer after installation.

## 2. Run the App
Open a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run these commands:

```bash
cd .gemini/antigravity/scratch/easy-healthy
npm install
npx expo start --web
```

This will launch the app in your browser!
